This project is a Lightcurve Analysis of Titan

As some setup, part from general packages, the most important python packages to install are rms-vicar and opencv. The first is for analysis and manipulations of images in VICAR or IMG format, while opencv is for general image analysis.

I have included ALL of the relevant data that I have used for this analysis in the form of I/F images for brightness phase curves and polarized images for polarization phase curves.
